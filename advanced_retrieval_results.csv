If the stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation, excess tax benefits or shortfalls may be recognized, which will in turn impact the effective tax rate. This variability in the tax effects of share-based compensation can lead to significant fluctuations in the effective tax rate from period to period.","['that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted.
