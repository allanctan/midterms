2,How does tax effects from share-based compensation impact the effective tax rate?,"Tax effects from share-based compensation can impact the effective tax rate significantly. The impact depends on the difference between the share-based compensation expense recognized in accounting and the deductions taken on the tax return, which are influenced by the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If the stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation, excess tax benefits or shortfalls may be recognized, affecting the effective tax rate. This variability in the tax effects of share-based compensation can lead to fluctuations in the effective tax rate from period to period.","['that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate.
