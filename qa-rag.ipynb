This common identifier allows for easier tracking and matching of accounts, making it more accurate to estimate the number of unique people using the products. However, in the context provided, it's mentioned that they do not require people to use a common identifier, so they rely on complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models to attribute multiple user accounts to individual people.\", 'In the computation of diluted EPS, net income is adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, such as restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under the Equity Incentive Plan. This adjustment includes reallocating net income as a result of the conversion of Class B to Class A common stock and any reallocation of net income to Class B common stock. The adjusted net income figure is then used in the calculation of diluted EPS.', 'Tax effects from share-based compensation can impact the effective tax rate significantly. The impact depends on factors such as the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. Differences between the share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on the tax return, influenced by the stock price, can either increase or decrease the effective tax rate. For example, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation can decrease the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rate. Therefore, fluctuations in stock price and the accounting treatment of share-based compensation can lead to variations in the effective tax rate from period to period.', 'Earnings per share (EPS) using the two-class method is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards. The diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion. Diluted EPS is then computed by dividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.', 'A decrease in user engagement can adversely affect advertising revenue in several ways. If users spend less time on the platform or engage less frequently, there will be fewer opportunities for ads to be displayed, reducing the overall ad impressions. This can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and, consequently, a decrease in revenue for the platform. Additionally, lower user engagement may result in a decline in the attractiveness of the platform to marketers, leading to a potential loss of advertising partners and revenue.', \"A PCAOB-registered public accounting firm plays a crucial role in expressing an opinion on a company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Their responsibilities include conducting audits in accordance with PCAOB standards to obtain reasonable assurance about the accuracy of the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls. The firm assesses risks, tests the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, and performs necessary procedures to evaluate the financial statements for material misstatements. Ultimately, the firm's opinion provides stakeholders with confidence in the reliability of the company's financial reporting.\", 'Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.', \"Acting in the best interests of stockholders is a key component of fiduciary duty. Fiduciary duty refers to the legal obligation of a person in a position of trust to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of corporate governance, directors and officers owe a fiduciary duty to the company's stockholders. This duty requires them to make decisions that they reasonably believe are in the best interests of the stockholders, even if those decisions may not align with their personal interests. Therefore, when a board member or officer acts in the best interests of stockholders, they are fulfilling their fiduciary duty.\", 'Dilutive securities, such as restricted stock units (RSUs), are taken into account in the calculation of diluted EPS by adjusting the net income for basic EPS by the effect of these securities. The diluted EPS calculation assumes the conversion of these securities into common stock and includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. If the inclusion of these securities would have an anti-dilutive effect, they are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.', \"The documents included in the Consolidated Financial Statements section of the Form 10-K are as follows:\\n1. Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\n2. Consolidated Balance Sheets\\n3. Consolidated Statements of Income\\n4. Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\\n5. Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\\n6. Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\\n7. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\", 'Assumptions play a significant role in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these statements requires making estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The use of estimates and judgments is necessary to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities, which may not be readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting estimates, such as loss contingencies, income taxes, and asset valuations, are particularly important as they have the potential to significantly impact the consolidated financial statements.', \"The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) plays a significant role in privacy compliance and addressing privacy law violations. It monitors compliance with regulations such as COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC can initiate administrative proceedings against companies for alleged violations, issue orders, and impose limitations or changes to businesses found to be in violation of privacy laws.

      "Based on the context provided, the use of a common identifier is not required to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products in the Family metrics. The calculations rely on complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models to estimate the number of unique people using the products, including matching user accounts without the need for a common identifier.\n",
      "Net income for the computation of diluted EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including restricted stock units (RSUs) awards under the Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, the net income is reallocated as a result of the conversion of Class B to Class A common stock.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the tax effects from share-based compensation can impact the effective tax rate significantly, sometimes from period to period. The impact depends on the difference between the share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on the tax return, which are influenced by the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. Excess tax benefits or shortfalls from share-based compensation can also impact the effective tax rate.\n",
      "Earnings per share is computed using the two-class method by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding.\n",
      "A decrease in user engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n",
      "Based on the context provided, the role of a PCAOB-registered public accounting firm in expressing an opinion on a company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting is to conduct audits in accordance with PCAOB standards to obtain reasonable assurance about the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements. The firm is responsible for assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Additionally, the firm is required to be independent with respect to the company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and regulations.\n",

      "This question cannot be answered based on the provided context as it does not contain any financial information in table form.\n",
      "Dilutive securities, such as restricted stock units (RSUs), are taken into account in the calculation of diluted EPS by adjusting the net income for basic EPS to account for the effect of dilutive securities. This adjustment includes excluding certain RSUs from the diluted EPS calculation if they would have an anti-dilutive effect. The diluted EPS is then computed by dividing the resulting adjusted net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.\n",

Assumptions are based on historical information and various other reasonable assumptions under the circumstances.\n",
