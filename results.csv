The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing\nbasis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial'

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets\nand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not'

We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.
