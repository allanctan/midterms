How does the use of a common identifier help in attributing multiple user accounts within and across products?,"The use of a common identifier can help in attributing multiple user accounts within and across products by providing a unique link or connection between different accounts that belong to the same individual.

How does tax effects from share-based compensation impact the effective tax rate?,"Tax effects from share-based compensation can impact the effective tax rate significantly. The impact depends on factors such as the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. Differences between the share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken on the tax return, influenced by the stock price, can either increase or decrease the effective tax rate. For example, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation can decrease the provision for income taxes and the effective income tax rate. Therefore, fluctuations in stock price and the accounting treatment of share-based compensation can lead to variations in the effective tax rate from period to period.","['that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price,\nwhich we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\n37'

How does a decrease in user engagement affect our advertising revenue?,"A decrease in user engagement can adversely affect advertising revenue in several ways. If users spend less time on the platform or engage less frequently, there will be fewer opportunities for ads to be displayed, reducing the overall ad impressions. This can lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and, consequently, a decrease in revenue for the platform. Additionally, lower user engagement may result in a decline in the attractiveness of the platform to marketers, leading to a potential loss of advertising partners and revenue.","['Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:\n•\ndecreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;\n•\nour inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;\n•\nproduct changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on\nour products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;\n•\nour inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;\n•\nour inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;\n•\nchanges to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the\n18'

There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active\nuser base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we and\nour competitors introduce new and different products and services.

How does acting in the best interests of stockholders relate to fiduciary duty?,"Acting in the best interests of stockholders is a key component of fiduciary duty. Fiduciary duty refers to the legal obligation of a person in a position of trust to act in the best interests of another party. In the context of corporate governance, directors and officers owe a fiduciary duty to the company's stockholders. This duty requires them to make decisions that they reasonably believe are in the best interests of the stockholders, even if those decisions may not align with their personal interests. Therefore, when a board member or officer acts in the best interests of stockholders, they are fulfilling their fiduciary duty.","['jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the\nattention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.

What role do assumptions play in the preparation of consolidated financial statements?,"Assumptions play a significant role in the preparation of consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these statements requires making estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The use of estimates and judgments is necessary to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities, which may not be readily apparent from other sources. Critical accounting estimates, such as loss contingencies, income taxes, and asset valuations, are particularly important as they have the potential to significantly impact the consolidated financial statements.","['Table of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial'
